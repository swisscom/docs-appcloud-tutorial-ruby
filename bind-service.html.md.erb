title: Bind a Service to Your App

The <a href="../service-offerings/index.html" target="_blank">service marketplace</a> has a large number of data stores, from Redis and MongoDB, to MariaDB (fork of MySQL) and RabbitMQ. You can run `cf marketplace` to get an overview. In this step you will add a small MariaDB database to your app.

Create the database:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service mariadb small my-mariadb
Creating service instance my-mariadb in org MyOrg / space MySpace as user@mydomain.com...
OK

Create in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service my-mariadb' to check operation status.

Attention: The plan `small` of service `mariadb` is not free.  The instance `my-mariadb` will incur a cost.  Contact your administrator if you think this is in error.
</pre>

This creates a small MariaDB database for you which we now have to bind to our application. Binding means that the credentials and URL of the service will be written dynamically into the environment variables of the app as `VCAP_SERVICES` and can hence be used directly from there.

Let's bind the new service to our existing application:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-service my-ruby-app my-mariadb
Binding service my-mariadb to app my-ruby-app in org MyOrg / space MySpace as user@mydomain.com...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage my-ruby-app' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
</pre>

After that we restage the application as suggested so that it includes the new credentials in its environment variables:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf restage my-ruby-app
Restaging app my-app in org MyOrg / space MySpace as user@mydomain.com...
-----> Downloaded app package (8.0K)
-------> Buildpack version 1.6.14
-----> Creating runtime environment

...
</pre>

Now we want to consume our new MariaDB from within our application. Change the `Gemfile` to add the `sequel`, `mysql` and `json` modules to your dependencies:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

ruby "2.2.4"

gem 'puma'
gem 'rack-coffee'

group :web do
  gem 'sequel'
  gem 'json'
  gem 'haml'
  gem 'sinatra'
  gem 'sass'
  gem 'mysql'
end

group :development do
  gem 'sinatra-reloader'
end
```

Now run `bundle install` again to install these new dependencies:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bundle install
Using backports 3.3.5
Using coffee-script-source 1.6.2
Using multi_json 1.7.6
Using tilt 1.4.1

...
</pre>

Now edit your `app.rb` file to use these modules to connect to the database specified in your `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable. We do this by adding a connection to the database, creating a `kittens` table and a route for the `/db` endpoint which returns the table of our MariaDB:

```ruby
# require dependencies
Bundler.require :web
Bundler.require :development if development?

# check if running in the cloud and setting the MariaDB settings accordingly
if ENV['VCAP_SERVICES']
  vcap_services = JSON.parse(ENV['VCAP_SERVICES'])
  DB = Sequel.connect(vcap_services['mariadb'][0]['credentials']['uri'])
else
  DB = Sequel.connect('mysql://localhost:3306/dbname')
end

# create database table for our kittens
DB.create_table? :kittens do
  primary_key :id
  String :name
end

# serve stylesheet
get '/style.css' do
  scss :style
end

# our basic route which renders the index view
get '/' do
  haml :index
end

# endpoint to create a new kitten (e.g. /create-kitten?name=garfield)
post '/create-kitten' do
  kitten_name = params[:name]
  DB[:kittens].insert(:name => kitten_name)
  'Kitten #{kitten_name} added'
end

# here you can retrieve all the kittens in our MariaDB
get '/db' do
  content_type :json
  kittens = DB[:kittens].all
  kittens.to_json
end

# our not-found route which serves the 404 view
not_found do
  haml :'404'
end
```

This ensures that when you access your app using the `/db` route, it will return all the kittens stored in your database. Currently there are no kittens so it will return an empty array. Sad...

But you can create new kittens by POSTing to the `create-kitten` endpoint with the kitten's name as a URL query parameter. You can do so using curl or any similar tool:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/create-kitten?name=garfield
</pre>

and then retrieve your new kitten at the `/db` endpoint.

The line

```ruby
if ENV['VCAP_SERVICES']
```

checks if the app is running in the cloud. If not, it falls back to the default local MariaDB url. This allows you to run your app locally as well as in the cloud without having to configure anything differently. So let's push it to the cloud using

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-ruby-app
</pre>

You can access other services like Redis or MongoDB in a similar matter, simply by binding them to your app and accessing them through the environment variables.
