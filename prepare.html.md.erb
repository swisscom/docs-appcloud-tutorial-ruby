In this step, you will prepare a simple application that can be deployed.
Execute the following commands to clone the sample application:

<pre class="terminal">
$ git clone https://github.com/swisscom/cf-sample-app-ruby.git
$ cd cf-sample-app-ruby
</pre>

You now have a functioning git repository that contains a simple application as well as a `Gemfile` file, which is used by Rubyâ€™s dependency manager bundler.
