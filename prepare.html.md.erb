In this step, you will prepare a simple application that can be deployed.
Execute the following commands to clone the sample application:

<pre class="terminal">
$ git clone https://github.com/swisscom/cf-sample-app-ruby.git
$ cd cf-sample-app-ruby
</pre>

You now have a functioning git repository that contains a simple <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" target="_blank">Sinatra</a> application as well as a `Gemfile` file, which is used by Rubyâ€™s dependency manager bundler.

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note</strong>: In case you are stuck during the tutorial, you can always check out the <a href="https://github.com/swisscom/cf-sample-app-ruby/tree/final-result" target="_blank"><code>final-result</code></a> branch of the sample app repo to see what your code should look like.
