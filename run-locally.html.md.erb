Running apps locally in your own dev environment does require some effort. Rails typically requires a database - and this sample application uses MySQL or MariaDB. Check out <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/binary-packages/" target="_blank">these instructions</a> for a local install.

The Rails app also uses a database, so youâ€™ll have to create the appropriate database and table using the rake task:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate

&gt; cf-sample-app-ruby@0.0.0 start /.../cf-sample-app-ruby
&gt; node ./bin/www
</pre>

Now start your application locally using the `npm start` command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ rails server
=> Booting WEBrick
=> Rails 4.2.6 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000
=> Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
=> Ctrl-C to shutdown server

...
</pre>

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your web browser. You should see your app running locally.

To stop the app from running locally, in the CLI, press `Ctrl+C` to exit.
