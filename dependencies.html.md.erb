title: Declare App Dependencies

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

<%= vars.product_short %> recognizes an app as a Ruby app by the existence of a `Gemfile` file in the root directory.

The demo app you deployed already has a `Gemfile`, and it looks something like this:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

ruby "2.2.4"

gem 'puma'
gem 'rack-coffee'

group :web do
  gem 'haml'
  gem 'sinatra'
  gem 'sass'
end

group :development do
  gem 'sinatra-reloader'
end
```

The `Gemfile` file specifies the dependencies that should be installed with your application. You can also use it to determine the version of Ruby that will be used to run your application on <%= vars.product_short %>.

When an app is deployed, Heroku reads this file and installs the appropriate Ruby version together with the dependencies using the `bundle install` command.

Now run `bundle install` in your local directory to install the dependencies, preparing your system for running the app locally:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bundle install
Using backports 3.3.5
Using coffee-script-source 1.6.2
Using multi_json 1.7.6
Using tilt 1.4.1

...
</pre>

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note</strong>: If you are getting <code>Your Ruby version is 2.3.0, but your Gemfile specified 2.2.4</code>, you can change the Ruby version in the <code>Gemfile</code>. Be aware though, that Cloud Foundry only accepts the Ruby versions specified <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/ruby-buildpack/blob/develop/manifest.yml" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

Once dependencies are installed, you will be ready to run your app locally.
